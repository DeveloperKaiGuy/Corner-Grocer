# Corner-Grocer
A project written in C++ as an assignment for CS-210 at SNHU. The challenge of this project was to create a software program for a hypothetical corner store in which the user could open a file and read the number of times a word occured within the file.
I believe the proficiencies I demonstrated in this code included good code organization, annotation (commenting), and input validation.
A few areas that could use improvement would be the versatility of the progranm (being able to change which file is imported), and the menu display/layout.
The most difficult parts of this code were the individual functions, as each one presented its own logical challenges. Of the functions, both the word frequency search and the frequency loading functions took the most time and were the hardest to navigate.
As far as which skills are transferrable, all of the skills practiced, honed, or otherwise used during the creation of this project will help with other projects.
This program is easily maintainable (and expandable) because it is broken into discrete functions, and therefore each part can be changed/reworked without changing much else. It is also readable because of how each function and what it does is clearly written in notations throughout the program.
